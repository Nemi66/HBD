                <h2>A Special Message</h2>
                <p>Do you remember our first chat, we kept talking cuz we found out our birthdays were so close to eachother and we wanted to know what else was similar in us. And months later we didnt want to lose eachother, fast forward and here we r now, so much in love and me being obsessed with you. I believe that the time we spent away from eachother, God is gonna reward us in some way for our loyalty and patience and ya not me too much cuz i did lose my patience in between.</p>
                <p>What u mean to me? U r my reason to live. It hasnt changed in 2 and a half years so it wont will in future too.</p>
                <p>I wanna promise u some things, How i intend to treat u</p>
                <p>I want to be your peace, A place where u forget all your pain</p>
                <p>I want to keep u happy, make u feel safe and cared for</p>
                <p>I want to make the world beautiful for u by paying attention to your every step</p>
                <p>I want to show what real love is and make u believe u deserve it all!</p>
