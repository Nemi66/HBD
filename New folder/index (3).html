                <h2>A Special Message</h2>
                <p>When we met we were like two persons who needed eachother badly that time. You brightened my world and I in return gave you the love which u nvr got as a brother. Later we fell in love with eachother and we made more memories, i mean wayyyy manyyy. This past year wasnt the best for us but we sure grew individually a lot, u changed and some were good changes and some bad meanwhile I realised how much i need u and u still need me ik that.</p>
                <p>What u mean to me? U r my reason to live. The day we dont work out or u decide im not good enough for u is the day I leave this world.</p>
